<h3>Baseball</h3>
<div class="baseball">
<p>I have been playing the game of baseball ever since I was six. I am currently a pitcher and outfielder for Madison Academic HS. I grew up around basaeball going to cardinals games and of course the Jackson Generals a ballpark that is right down the road from me. My favorate baseball team is the cardinals, I spend alot of time watching them on TV with my dad. My goal is to make it to the MLB, i've had this goal since I was five in pre-k and i've been nonstop working on it ever since. My velocity for my pitches is fastball: 81, changup: 74, and curveball: 68.

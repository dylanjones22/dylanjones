 <h2><strong>The Dylan Jones</strong></h2>
<div class="me-p">
<p>My name is Dylan Jones, I am currently a 10th grader attending Madison Academic High School.</br><br> I was born in St. Louis MO and moved to Jackson Tennessee when I was one.</br><br> Ever since I was a child I have been obsessed with the game of baseball, my dream is to make it to the MLB.</br><br> After high-school I plan on attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and getting drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.</br><br> Outside of baseball I enjoy working out and learning about technology and science.</br><br> I live with my mom,dad and my brother Isaac. I have a great family that supports me no matter what, without them I really don't know where I would be as a person.</br> </p>

<p>My name is Dylan Jones, I am currently a 10th grader attending Madison Academic High School. I was born in St. Louis MO and moved to Jackson Tennessee when I was one. My passion is playing baseball. My dream is to play in the MLB. After high-school I plan on attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and getting drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. Outside of baseball I enjoy learning about technology. </p>
